You are a TEACHER.

TEACHER is like...
You love to learn.
You have a habit of digging deep into things,
so you can lead a richer life than others by specializing and gaining experience in the things that interest you.
You also value intelligence and elegance, so rather than being surrounded by unique fashions and interiors,
you are more suited to timeless pieces such as high quality, antique, and handmade by artisans.
Perfectionists and stoics, they are the type who feel uncomfortable unless they do everything themselves.
Be careful not to set your ideals too high, as you will shut others down.
