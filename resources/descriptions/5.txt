You are a KING.

KING is like...
You have a strong will to persevere against all odds, and once you have made up your mind,
you will carry it through to the end.
You do not allow yourself to be weak.
You are very clear about what you like and what you don't like, so people
who try to play games or play it off against you will stay away from you.
Therefore, the people around you may have a split opinion of you. But that doesn't matter to you.
You will take action based on your strong belief that "I am me.
It is important for you to follow your heart rather than listening to the words of those around you. 
There is no dream that you cannot achieve.
