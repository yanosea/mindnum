You are a QUEEN.

QUEEN is like...
You have been glamorous, charismatic, and have been the center of attention since you were a child.
You are probably seen as a fashion leader in the workplace.
You have clear likes and dislikes, and you have your own style.
They have a strong sense of justice and dislike lies and dishonesty.
Because of their strong maternal instincts,
they may sometimes fall in love with an unreliable member of the opposite sex whom they need to protect.
You are also blessed with position, power, and money,
and there are many entrepreneurs and successful people who are on the top of the ladder.
You are an empress, so don't hold back or worry about what people think of you.
