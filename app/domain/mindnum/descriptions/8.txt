You are a FIGHTER.

FIGHTER is like...
You are stoic and have the "fortitude" to never follow anything you don't agree with.
You will never allow anyone to stand in your way.
Even if you are dealing with your boss, you will not give in and will push forward toward your goals with all your might.
However, he is actually a very sensitive and delicate person at heart.
Because he stubbornly never changes his opinions, he is often misunderstood by those around him.
You also prefer to work in small groups rather than in groups, as you feel comfortable working alone.
It is your intuition and unfounded confidence that will lead you to success.
