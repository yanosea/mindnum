You are a CHALLENGER.

CHALLENGER is like...
You feel very constrained to live your life doing the same things as others or following what others tell you to do.
You find joy in life in exploring your own path and challenging yourself until you are satisfied.
Stiff ideas, such as repeating the same job day after day and relationships that feel like a rut, are not suited to your style.
You are an "upstart" type who fulfills your dreams through your abilities.
It is important to find "my style" without fear of failure and always remember to challenge yourself.
