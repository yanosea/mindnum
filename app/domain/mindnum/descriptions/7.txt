You are a LOVER.

LOVER is like...
You are a romantic who lives for love to the point that your life changes completely depending on the kind of person you date.
Love is an indispensable spice in your life.
Because of your romantic nature, you may fall in love with a married man or a playboy and end up in a muddle.
On the other hand, when you are in love, you are invincible.
Your aura shines brightly and you become more and more attractive.
By nurturing your love, you will be able to achieve even greater happiness.
